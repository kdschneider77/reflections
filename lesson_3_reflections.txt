When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  When you want to be able to work from multiple locations or work with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   If people are working on the same repository or you are working on mulitple changes

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

   Forks are GitHub's version of Cloning used to easily create a new origin repository to edit with out effecting the Original.  Clone is used to duplicate that forked repository to your local machine.  branching is something that occurs when working withing the repository on your own machine.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Then you can compare with diff the changes that have been made

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    With out Git you would have to save a file on the cloud to be updated or send files back and forth.  There would be many more steps in the process.  GitHub simplifies the process and makes it easier to stay organized.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    With more complicated projects and features that may appear in different versions you want to keep separate for split testing.  It makes it more complicated though it is much more simple to use just the master.
